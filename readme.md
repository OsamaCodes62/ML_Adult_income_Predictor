## Project Documentation: Income Classification Using Machine Learning

### Overview
This project demonstrates a machine learning pipeline for classifying whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000/year based on census data. The project uses the XGBoost classifier and various preprocessing techniques to build a robust and interpretable model.

---

### Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handling missing values using the most frequent strategy.
  - Label encoding categorical features for model compatibility.
  - Scaling numerical features for improved model performance.

- **Model Training and Evaluation**:
  - Training an XGBoost classifier for high accuracy and performance.
  - Hyperparameter tuning using grid search and cross-validation.
  - Evaluation with confusion matrix, accuracy, and classification reports.

- **Model Explainability**:
  - SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values for interpreting feature importance and understanding model predictions.

- **Predictions**:
  - Accepts custom input to predict income category (`Above $50K` or `Below $50K`).

### Libraries and Dependencies
The project relies on the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`: For numerical computations.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn`: For creating exploratory and result visualizations.
- `scikit-learn`: For data preprocessing, model evaluation, and utilities.
- `xgboost`: For implementing and training the XGBoost classifier.
- `shap`: For model explainability and feature importance analysis.

### Results
- **Model Accuracy**: Achieved a high accuracy score using cross-validation, ensuring robust performance.
- **SHAP Analysis**: Provided clear insights into which features influenced predictions the most.

### Usage
1. **Install Dependencies**: Use the `requirements.txt` file to install necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Run the Code**: Execute the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train the model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions.
3. **Custom Prediction**: Input user-defined data to predict income classification.
